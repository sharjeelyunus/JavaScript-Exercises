//Using this function, answer the questions below:

            whatHappens = "you encounter a monster";

    }
    return whatHappens;
}

//#2 return value when moveCommand("forward");
undefined

//#3 return value when moveCommand("back");
"you arrived home"

//#4 return value when moveCommand("right");
"you found a river"

//#5 return value when moveCommand("left");
undefined

//BONUS: practice makes perfect. Go and write your own switch function. It takes time to get used to the syntax!
